# Simple On-line Multi-player Ping-Pong Game

This is a simple game developed using Construct 2 (which will be discontinued by July 2021).

Thus, feel free to use and play.

## Installation

Open in Construct 2 then export it (we recommend exporting as HTML 5 project).

Place it on a web server (local or remote) and access in two distinct machines.

## Ready to play

On the root directory you can find a Pont directory that already contains the game ready to place on the server
